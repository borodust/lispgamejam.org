<br>

* Your game must be written in a dialect of Lisp.
* You may use whichever general-purpose Lisp game libraries are available (see resource links below for a partial list.)
* You may start with a simple existing lisp game (library examples/minigames, boilerplate, small Emacs games etc) as the basis of your project, and this is especially helpful for newcomers. If you do re-use significant code, please make an effort to substantially modify what you started with, by adding new code and new ideas. Also, please specify what you re-used, if anything.
* You may also develop your own **general-purpose** engines, tools, tests, and boilerplate **before the Jam begins**. That way you can "hit the ground running" and have your basic code ready. The point is to design and code the gameplay during the Jam; there is no harm in preparing and testing out your general framework in advance (displaying images and objects, playing sounds, basic stuff.)
* Re-use of free assets (images, sound, music) is permissible as long as you disclose what you used.
* Failed submissions (i.e. your game doesn't run by the deadline) can try to get extra help on the channel after the jam, to get them working. No stress, nobody is left out if they ran into problems that day, and everyone can still share their work and discuss what they learned. **You can also ask on #lispgames for a Late Submission Code that will allow you to submit your finished work after the deadline, so it will still be part of the collection**.
* Please deliver at least a source archive (ZIP or TAR.GZ) with README.txt and instructions on how to run the game. Consider also providing precompiled binaries if possible.
* Advice: **keep the game design simple**, stay focused, and ask the IRC for help or inspiration if you need it!
* Consider writing up a "postmortem" answering these questions, in order to share what you've learned:
  * What dialect/tools/libraries did you use?
  * What sort of game did you choose to make, and why?
  * What went right, what were some successes?
  * What went wrong?
  * What did you learn?
  * What did Lisp enable you to do well in this entry?
  * What challenges did Lisp present in making your entry happen?
  * If you are comfortable answering, please mention how long you have used lisp and describe previous gamedev experience, if any.
